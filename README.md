### Jupyter notebook 
The project will be completed using a jupyter notebook that consists of 2 parts viz:

### Part 1: 
 (i) Preprocessing and cleaning (ii) Exploratory data analysis

### Part 2: 
 Modelling which will involve the use of a Market Basket Analysis to learn different rules (associations) between products sold. 

 ----
 ### Visualizations in the dataset
There are three figures provided. These are visualizations created in the exploratory data analysis (section ii) of Part 1. All three 
visualizations were created using Plotly express. The charts have also been included as an image file with links attached.A summary of the each chart is provided below:
