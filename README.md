### Jupyter notebook 
The project will be completed using a jupyter notebook that consists of 2 parts viz:

### Part 1: 
 (i) Preprocessing and cleaning (ii) Exploratory data analysis

### Part 2: 
 Modelling which will involve the use of a Market Basket Analysis to learn different rules (associations) between products sold.

 ### Visualizations in the dataset
The charts provided below are included as an image file with links attached. Plotly express was used to create both charts as part 
of the exploratory data analysis phase of the project.
